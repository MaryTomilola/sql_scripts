 🌳 Parks & Recreation SQL Practice Queries

📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains a collection of **SQL practice queries** using a Parks & Recreation dataset.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency with different SQL concepts — from basic filtering to advanced operations like triggers and events.  
While this is not a full EDA project, it serves as a **SQL playground** to showcase problem-solving and query-writing skills.

 🔑 Key SQL Concepts Practiced  
- **CASE Statements**  
  - Categorized data into custom groups  
  - Created conditional logic for reporting  

- **Subqueries**  
  - Nested queries for deeper analysis  
  - Compared records against aggregated values  

- **UNIONS**  
  - Combined multiple result sets into one report  

- **Triggers & Events**  
  - Built automation to log changes and schedule tasks  

- **Other SQL Techniques**  
  - Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)  
  - Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)  
  - Window functions for ranking and trend detection
